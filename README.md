# Normal-Uniform-and-Exponential-Distributions-Simulations
This is a project I did in the Spring of 2017 for a graduate course in Statistical Computing. I was asked to find the descriptive statistics of 1000 simulations of a distribution, specifically to find the mean, median, midrange, and interquartile range of the simulations. I was asked to find these statistics for simulations of sample sizes of 10, 30, and 100. Additionally, I was aslo asked to find each of these sample sizes for Normal, Uniform, and Exponential distributions.

I sought to solve this problem by writing a function that would produce the desired statistics. I wrote a function for each distribution, that when it was given the sample size, it would run 1000 simulations and return the mean, median, midrange, and interquartile range of the simulations. I also produced boxplots, density plots, and pairs plots of these statistics. I wrote one of these functions for Normal, Uniform, and Exponential distributions, and I ran each for each sample size of 10, 30, and 100.
