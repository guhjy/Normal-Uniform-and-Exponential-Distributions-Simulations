# Normal-Uniform-and-Exponential-Distributions-Simulations
This is a project I did in the Spring of 2017 for a graduate course in Statistical Computing. I was asked to find the descriptive statistics of 1000 simulations of a distribution, specifically to find the mean, median, midrange, and interquartile range of the simulations. I was asked to find these statistics for simulations of sample sizes of 10, 30, and 100. Additionally, I was aslo asked to find each of these sample sizes for Normal, Uniform, and Exponential distributions.

I sought to solve this problem by writing a function that would produce the desired statistics. I wrote a function for each distribution. When each function was given the sample size, it would run 1000 simulations and return mean, median, and standard deviations of the simulations' mean, median, midrange, and interquartile range. I also produced boxplots, density plots, and pairs plots of these statistics. I wrote one of these functions for Normal, Uniform, and Exponential distributions, and I ran each for each sample size of 10, 30, and 100.
