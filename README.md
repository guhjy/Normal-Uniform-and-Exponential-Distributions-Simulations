# Normal-Uniform-and-Exponential-Distributions-Simulations
This is a project I did in the Spring of 2017 for a graduate course in Statistical Computing. I was asked to find the descriptive statistics of 1000 simulations of a distribution, specifically to find the mean, median, midrange, and interquartile range of the simulations. I was asked to find these statistics for 1000 simulations of sample sizes of 10, 30, and 100. I was aslo asked to find each of these sample sizes for Normal, Uniform, and Exponential distributions.
